# Nexus-AI System Constitution

All code generated by Nexus-AI must adhere to the following strict rules. Deviations are blocked and require a Secure Rewrite.

## 1. Security & Data Integrity
- **C-001: No Raw SQL**. Use ORMs or parameterized queries exclusively. Raw string concatenation in queries is strictly prohibited.
- **C-002: Mandatory Sanitization**. All user inputs must be sanitized before being used in any logic (filesystem, shell, or network).
- **C-003: No Secrets in Code**. API keys, passwords, and tokens must never be hardcoded. Use environment variables.

## 2. Type Safety & Reliability
- **C-101: TypeScript Strictness**. Avoid `any`. Use interfaces and types for all data structures.
- **C-102: Python Type Hinting**. All Python functions must include type hints for parameters and return values.
- **C-103: Error Handling**. All async operations and I/O must be wrapped in `try-except` (Python) or `try-catch` (JS/TS) blocks with meaningful logging.

## 3. Architecture & Patterns
- **C-201: Module Isolation**. Keep logic decoupled. Avoid circular dependencies.
- **C-202: Documentation**. Every new function or class must have a concise docstring or JSDoc explanation.
- **C-203: Resource Management**. Always explicitly close database connections, file handles, and network sockets (use `with` or `finally`).

## 4. Performance
- **C-301: Algorithmic Efficiency**. Avoid O(n^2) or worse complexity where O(log n) or O(n) is possible.
- **C-302: Memory Awareness**. Large datasets must be processed in streams or chunks, not loaded entirely into memory.
